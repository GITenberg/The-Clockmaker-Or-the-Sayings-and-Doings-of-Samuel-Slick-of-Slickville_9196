description: Sam Slick of Slickville, Connecticut, is a Yankee clock-peddler who accompanies
  a visiting English gentleman on an unforgettable tour of early nineteenth-century
  Nova Scotia. His shrewd observations and witty commentaries make up the thirty-three
  sketches of The Clockmaker. First serialized in 1835 and 1836 and then published
  together in late 1836 in response to public demand, the sketches of The Clockmaker
  established Judge Thomas Chandler Haliburton as a satirical humorist of international
  stature. The New Canadian Library edition is an unabridged reprint of the complete
  original text. From the Paperback edition.
